## Introduction

This library provides a Kotlin Coroutines based Retrofit call adapter for wrapping your API responses in
a `NetworkResponse` type.

See [Installation](#installation) for setup instructions.

## Network Response

`NetworkResponse<S, E>` is a Kotlin sealed interface with the following states:

- `Success`: Represents successful network calls (2xx response codes)
- `Error`: Represents unsuccessful network calls
  - `ServerError`: Server errors (non 2xx responses)
  - `NetworkError`: IO Errors, connectivity problems
  - `UnknownError`: Any other errors, like serialization exceptions

It is generic on two types: a success response (`S`), and an error response (`E`).

- `S`: Kotlin representation of a successful API response
- `E`: Representation of an unsuccessful API response

## Usage

Suppose an API returns the following body for a successful response:

_Successful Response_

```json
{
  "name": "John doe",
  "age": 21
}
```

And this for an unsuccessful response:

_Error Response_

```json
{
  "message": "The requested person was not found"
}
```

You can create two data classes to model the these responses:

```kotlin
data class PersonResponse(val name: String, val age: Int)

data class ErrorResponse(val message: String)
```

Then modify your Retrofit service to return a `NetworkResponse`:

```kotlin
@GET("/person")
suspend fun getPerson(): NetworkResponse<PersonResponse, ErrorResponse>>

// You can also request for `Deferred` responses
@GET("/person")
fun getPersonAsync(): Deferred<NetworkResponse<PersonResponse, ErrorResponse>>
```

Finally, add this call adapter factory to your Retrofit instance:

```kotlin
Retrofit.Builder()
    .addCallAdapterFactory(NetworkResponseAdapterFactory())
    .build()
```

And voila! You can now consume your API as:

```kotlin
// Repository.kt
suspend fun getPerson() {
    when (val person = apiService.getPerson()) {
        is NetworkResponse.Success -> {
            /* Successful response */
        }
        is NetworkResponse.Error -> {
            /* Handle error */
        }
    }

    // Or, if you care about the type of the error:
    when (val person = apiService.getPerson()) {
        is NetworkResponse.Success -> {
            /* ... */
        }
        is NetworkResponse.ServerError -> {
            /* ... */
        }
        is NetworkResponse.NetworkError -> {
            /* ... */
        }
        is NetworkResponse.UnknownError -> {
            /* ... */
        }
    }
}
```

See [Special Cases](./special-cases.md) for dealing with more complicated scenarios.

## Benefits

Modelling errors as a part of your state is a recommended practice. This library helps you deal with scenarios where you can successfully recover from errors, and extract meaningful information from them too!

- `NetworkResponseAdapter` provides a much cleaner solution than Retrofit's built in `Call` type for dealing with errors.`Call` throws an exception on any kind of an error, leaving it up to you to catch it and parse it manually to figure out what went wrong. `NetworkResponseAdapter` does all of that for you and returns the result in an easily consumable `NetworkResponse` subtype.

- The RxJava retrofit adapter treats non 2xx response codes as errors, which seems silly in the context of Rx where errors terminate streams. Also, just like the `Call<T>` type, it makes you deal with all types of errors in an `onError` callback, where you have to manually parse it to find out exactly what went wrong.

- Using the `Response` class provided by Retrofit is cumbersome, as you have to manually parse error bodies with it.

## Installation

Add the Jitpack repository to your list of repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

And then add the dependency in your gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.haroldadmin:NetworkResponseAdapter:(latest-version)"
}
```
