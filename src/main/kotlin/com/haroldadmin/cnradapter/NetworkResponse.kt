 * A network request is considered to be successful if it received a 2xx response code, and unsuccessful

 * - Non-2xx response from the server, the [NetworkResponse] is [NetworkResponse.ServerError] containing the
 * deserialized body of the response ([E])
 * - Internet connectivity problems, the [NetworkResponse] is [NetworkResponse.NetworkError]
 * - Any other problems (e.g. Serialization errors), the [NetworkResponse] is [NetworkResponse.UnknownError].
